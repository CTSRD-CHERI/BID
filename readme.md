# BID - Bluespec SystemVerilog ISA Definition framework
BID is a [Bluespec SystemVerilog](http://wiki.bluespec.com/bluespec-systemverilog-and-compiler) library to specify instruction sets in a concise manner. It relies on the [Recipe](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/Recipe) and [BitPat](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/BitPat) libraries. It also makes extensive use of the `ModuleCollect` Bluespec type to register semantic functions describing instructions'behaviours along with their associated bit pattern. This is a work in progress.
